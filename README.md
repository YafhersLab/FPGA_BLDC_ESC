# ⚙️ BLDC Motor Driver (ESC) – Custom FPGA Shield (Artix-7)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project consists of the design and development of a **custom BLDC motor driver (Electronic Speed Controller, ESC)** implemented as a **hardware shield for the Avanxe 7 FPGA board**, based on an **Artix-7 FPGA**.

The main objective was to control **BLDC thruster motors for an ROV** directly from an FPGA.  
For this purpose, a **BLDC power PCB was designed from scratch**, and all motor control logic was implemented in **VHDL**, demonstrating a complete hardware–software co-design workflow.

This project showcases skills in:
- FPGA-based motor control  
- Power electronics  
- Digital design with VHDL  
- Control system integration and simulation

## 🎯 Motivation
Traditional BLDC motor control is commonly handled by microcontrollers or DSPs.  
In this project, the goal was to explore **FPGA-based BLDC control**, leveraging parallelism and deterministic timing to achieve precise switching and control of power MOSFETs for ROV propulsion systems.
